	Imagine how frustrating it would be to use a computer if it was never able to find anything.  You wouldn't be able to open any programs or files because it wouldn't be able to find them and the whole computer would end up being useless.  Thankfully we have been able to make computers very good at finding things.  With the millions and millions of pieces of information that computers have to look through to find what we ask from them it is important that computers be able to find things quickly.  For this reason Computer Scientist's, who program computers, have come up with clever ways of to allow computers to find things quickly and efficiently.  One way to make it easier to find things for people and computers alike is to keep things organized.  For computers this means that they usually keep all of their information in sorted order (Don't forget to check out our Sorting activity at some point if you haven't already!).

	One way that computers could search for things is in a linear fashion.  Linear means moving in a straight line.  In the context of searching it means looking at the first item out of a group to see if it's the item you are looking for and then moving on and looking at the second, third, fourth, etc. items in order until you find the one you are looking for.  Following this technique you will find what you are looking for, but it may take you a long time.  The reason it takes a long time is if the item you are looking for is in the back of the group then you have to look at every item from the group.  Computers deal with large amounts of information so the group it has to look through could contain million and millions of items.

	Having things in sorted order makes it a lot easier to find things.  One of the clever techniques that computers can use when things are sorted is called Binary Search.  The binary search algorithm (a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations, especially by a computer) works by taking a list of sorted items and looking at the middle item.  If the middle item turns out to be the item you were looking for then you're done!  Otherwise, you can throw out all of the items on one side of the middle because you know that the item you're looking for is bigger/smaller then all of them.  You then take the remaining items and repeat the process until you find the item you are looking for.  One example, assuming that the list is sorted in ascending order(from smallest to largest), if we look at the middle item and see that the number we are looking for is larger then the middle item then we throw out all of the items from the beginning of the list up through the middle item.  This leaves us with only the items that were larger then the middle item.  So now we look at the item that is in the middle of all of the items larger then the first item we looked at.  This time we see that the item we just looked at is larger then the number we are looking for so we can throw out all of the items larger then the one we just checked.  By following these steps we are able to decrease the remaining number of items to look through by half each time we look at an item from the list.

	In these activities you will click on jars to check what number they contain and then drag the jar that you know/think contains the number you are looking for into the box below the jars to check if you are right.  You are given a limited number of clicks to look at the values of the jars so it would be for the best if you thought of a series of steps you could follow that would allow to find the number in an efficient manner. *Cough* *Cough* Binary Search *Cough* *Cough*
