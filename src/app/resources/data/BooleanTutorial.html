You may not realize it but you probably use boolean logic everyday.  Boolean logic is when everything is reduced to True or False.  The three main things that we do in boolean logic is AND, OR, and NOT statements together. AND is called conjunction and it is used when something should be True only if both of it's conditions are True.  OR is called disjunction and is used if something should be True if at least one of it's conditions is True. NOT is called negation and it negates or reverses the value it is applied to.  Boolean logic is very important in computers for the same reason that computers have to use binary, they work with only two states: True and False.  Deep within the inner workings of computers, down at the level of the electrical circuits boolean logic is the true workhorse of computers and it is what allows computers to do all of their calculations.

So you've probably used AND when you're trying to set out specific conditions that have to be met.  One example could be if you're trying to describe your large, green bookbag with black zippers to a friend.  You would describe it as being large AND green AND having black zippers. AND is often used to narrow down a selection.

<p>
On the other hand OR is often used to make a selection more general.  If someone asks you what you want to eat for supper and you say pizza then you've selected one thing.  If you said “pizza OR Chinese” then you've made your selection more general because now there's two options.

<p>
Often used in combination with AND and OR, NOT is often a time saver.  Say you were given a choice of ten places to eat and you enjoyed all of them except for the 9th option.  Instead of saying “option 1 OR option 2 OR option 3...” you would simply say “NOT 9th option”.

In the following activity you'll be building statements that will target the selected objects and also determining which objects are targeted by a given statement.
</p>
<p>
The properties of the objects you'll be using to identify them are their shape, color, and pattern. The possible shapes are circle, square, and star.  The possible colors are blue, red, and black. The possible patterns are solid, outline, and gradient (faded).
</p>
<p>
When asked to build the statement then you will be placing boxes containing properties (blue,  solid, red, circle, star...) and boxes containing the operators (AND, OR, NOT) into empty boxes in the bottom to create the statement (ex: red AND solid OR circle) that select the targeted objects.  The blue boxes are only for operators and a blue box on a line by itself can be used to start a new statement that will be combined with the statements above it.
</p>
<p>
When asked to select the objects targeted by the given statement then you will simply click on objects to select/unselect them.  Be careful to make sure that you only have targeted objects selected or you won't complete the problem.
