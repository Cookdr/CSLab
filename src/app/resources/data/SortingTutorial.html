One of the reasons that people invented computers was handle large amounts of information.  Part of the reasons computers are able to handle these large amounts of data is that they keep the information organized.  Computers wouldn't be able to put all of their information to use as well if they didn't keep it organized.  One of the ways computers keep the information organized is by sorting it.  In order to sort items you have to have some system of comparing and ordering items.  One such system is alphabetical order.  One example of something that uses alphabetical order is dictionaries.  Like computers dictionaries have to keep their information organized so that it's easy to use.  What if the dictionary didn't sort it's words and they were all just randomly stuck in there?  It wouldn't be very easy to use would it?

So once a system of comparison is determined then it comes time to start comparing items in order to determine their place in the group.  This is where things get tricky.  Without fixed steps to follow (also known as an algorithm) then it is very difficult to take an unsorted group of items and sort them.  One algorithm that can be followed to sort a group of objects is called Selection Sort. With selection sort you compare the items in a manner to find the smallest item of the group.  To do this you can start by comparing the first two items and keeping track of the one that was the smallest.  You would then compare whichever was smallest against the next item in the list and once again keeping the one that was the smallest.  By following this process of keeping the smallest item as you work your way through the group you are guaranteed to end up with the smallest item after looking through the whole list.  You place this item to the side as the start of a new group and repeat the process to find the smallest item out of the items and place this behind the first item you set aside.  By continuing this process of finding the smallest item and adding it to the end of your new group when you run out of items in your first group (your unsorted group) then the new group that you've been building up will be completely sorted!

Keep that algorithm in mind as you work through these next activities.  Your task in these activities is to take a group of jars with unknown weights and sort them into ascending (lightest to heaviest) order by comparing two jars at a time using the balance scale.  You should build up your group of sorted jars in the box below the scale.  If that box ever turns red then it's letting you know that the jars inside are not in sorted order.  You can drop jars into the middle of the scale to temporarily set them aside.  Click on the “Empty” button to add these jars back into the unsorted group.  It may be a good idea to set aside the heavier jars so you don't accidentally weigh them twice.
